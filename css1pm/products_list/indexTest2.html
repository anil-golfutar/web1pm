                Indoor plants, also known as houseplants or pot plants, are
                cultivated indoors for aesthetic or practical purposes. They add
                natural beauty and can improve air quality in indoor spaces.
                Many indoor plants are tropical or semi-tropical species that
                thrive in the warm, humid conditions often found indoors.
